# Cracking the coding interviews

Here you can find my solutions for the quizzes

## Chapter 1 | Arrays and Strings

### 1.3

Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer

> NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine An extra copy of the array is not
